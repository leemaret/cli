# Command Line Interface applications 

I write a lot of CLI apps as part of learning new languages. This repository is used as a parent repo for each individual application, which is added as a submodule and stored in its own repo.

## Applications

Sorted by language.

### Rust

- hellor: the default Rust Cargo hello world, plus tests
- truer: a rewrite of POSIX comman `true`

### Go

TBD
